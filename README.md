# ~~Scoop~~ Shovel

Command-line installer for Windows

## Goals

Scriptable, user-friendly command line installation of applications with a minimal amount of friction.

- Eliminate permission/UAC popup
- Avoid GUI wizard-style installers
    - Use [winget][winget] for interactive installations
- Do not pollute `PATH`
- Skip unexpected side-effects from installing and uninstalling programs
    - Applications installed by scoop usually do not execute application specific installers
        - If you are looking for command line tool for executing application specific installers, refer to [winget][winget] or [chocolatey][choco]
- Dependencies resolving for other scoop installed applications

```powershell
scoop install sudo
sudo scoop install 7zip git openssh --global
scoop install aria2 curl grep sed less touch
scoop install python ruby go perl
```

## Requirements

- Windows 7 SP1+ / Windows Server 2008+
- [PowerShell 5](https://aka.ms/wmf5download) (or later, include [PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-6)) and [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) (or later)
- PowerShell must be enabled for your user account e.g. `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

## Installation

[Refer to new installer how to install base scoop.](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Install#scoop-uninstaller)

As soon as base scoop is installed do the following:

1. `scoop install 7zip git`
1. `scoop config SCOOP_REPO 'https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-Core'`
1. `scoop update`
1. `scoop checkup`

Once installed, run `scoop help` for additional information.

## Multi-connection downloads with `aria2`

Scoop can utilize [`aria2`](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) to use multi-connection downloads.
Simply install `aria2` through Scoop and it will be used for all downloads afterward.

```powershell
scoop install aria2
```

Refer to `scoop help config` how to adjust aria2 specific configuration.

## Applications installed by scoop

The apps that install best with Scoop are commonly called "portable" apps: i.e. compressed program files that run stand-alone when extracted and don't have side-effects like changing the registry or putting files outside the program directory.

Since installers are common, Scoop supports them too (and their uninstallers).

Scoop is also great at handling single-file programs and Powershell scripts.
These don't even need to be compressed.
See the [runat](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/blob/master/bucket/runat.json) package for an example: it's really just a GitHub gist.
