# Usage: scoop virustotal [* | app1 app2 ...] [options]
# Summary: Look for app's hash on virustotal.com
# Help: Look for app's hash (MD5, SHA1 or SHA256) on virustotal.com
#
# Use a single '*' for app to check all installed apps.
#
# The download's hash is also a key to access VirusTotal's scan results.
# This allows to check the safety of the files without even downloading
# them in many cases.  If the hash is unknown to VirusTotal, the
# download link is printed to submit it to VirusTotal.
#
# If you have signed up to VirusTotal's community, you have an API key
# that this script can use to submit unknown packages for inspection
# if you use the `--scan' flag.  Tell scoop about your API key with:
#
#   scoop config virustotal_api_key <your API key: 64 lower case hex digits>
#
# Exit codes:
# 0 -> success
# 1 -> problem parsing arguments
# 2 -> at least one package was marked unsafe by VirusTotal
# 4 -> at least one exception was raised while looking for info
# 8 -> at least one package couldn't be queried because its hash type
#      isn't supported by VirusTotal, the manifest couldn't be found
#      or didn't contain a hash
# Note: the exit codes (2, 4 & 8) may be combined, e.g. 6 -> exit codes
#       2 & 4 combined
#
# Options:
#   -h, --help                Show help for this command.
#   -a, --arch <32bit|64bit>  Use the specified architecture, if the app supports it.
#   -s, --scan                For packages where VirusTotal has no information, send download URL
#                             for analysis (and future retrieval). This requires you to configure
#                             your virustotal_api_key (see help entry for config command).
#   -n, --no-depends          By default, all dependencies are checked, too.  This flag allows
#                             to avoid it.
