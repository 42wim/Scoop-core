# Usage: scoop virustotal [<OPTIONS>] <APP>...
# Summary: Search virustotal database for potential viruses in files provided in manifest(s).
# Help: You can use '*' in place of <APP> to check all installed applications.
#
# The hash of file is also a key to access VirusTotal's scan results.
# This allows to check the safety of the files without even downloading
# them in many cases. If the hash is unknown to VirusTotal, the
# download link is printed and VirusTotal detection is triggered.
#
#   scoop config 'virustotal_api_key' <your API key: 64 lower case hex digits>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 -> success
#   1 -> problem parsing arguments
#   2 -> at least one package was marked unsafe by VirusTotal
#   4 -> at least one exception was raised while looking for info
#   8 -> at least one package couldn't be queried because its hash type
#        isn't supported by VirusTotal, the manifest couldn't be found
#        or didn't contain a hash
#   Note: the exit codes (2, 4 & 8) may be combined, e.g. 6 -> exit codes
#         2 & 4 combined
#
# Options:
#   -h, --help                Show help for this command.
#   -a, --arch <32bit|64bit>  Use the specified architecture, if the manifest supports it.
#   -s, --scan                For packages where VirusTotal has no information, send download URL for analysis (and future retrieval).
#                             This requires you to configure your virustotal_api_key (see help entry for config command).
#   -n, --no-depends          By default, all dependencies are checked, too.  This flag allows
#                             to avoid it.
